# Inbound Webhooks

next-forge provides webhook handling for external services through the API application. Webhooks are processed securely with proper verification and structured event handling.

## Payment Events

The payment webhook handler processes Stripe events and updates user subscriptions accordingly.

### Stripe Webhooks

The `/api/webhooks/payments` endpoint handles Stripe webhook events:

- `checkout.session.completed` - User subscription created
- `subscription_schedule.canceled` - User subscription canceled

### Configuration

Set up your Stripe webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard:
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/payments`
- Events: Select the events you want to handle

Make sure you set the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.

## Authentication Events

With Better Auth, authentication events are handled directly in your application without requiring external webhooks. This provides several advantages:

- **Real-time Processing**: Events are processed immediately
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for webhook delivery services
- **Better Error Handling**: Direct error handling without webhook retry logic
- **Simplified Testing**: Test authentication flows locally without webhook setup

### Event Tracking

You can track authentication events directly in your authentication flows:

```typescript
// Example: Track user registration
await signUp.email({
  email,
  password,
  name,
})

// Track the event immediately
analytics.capture({
  event: 'User Signed Up',
  distinctId: user.id,
  properties: {
    email: user.email,
    provider: 'email',
  },
})
```

### Custom Authentication Events

If you need to handle custom authentication events, you can create your own event system:

```typescript
// Custom event handler
export const trackAuthEvent = (event: string, userId: string, properties?: object) => {
  analytics.capture({
    event,
    distinctId: userId,
    properties,
  })
}
```

## Security

All webhook endpoints include proper security measures:

- **Signature Verification**: Verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
- **Environment Configuration**: Webhook secrets are managed through environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

## Local Development

For local webhook testing:

1. **Payment Webhooks**: Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local development server
2. **Authentication Events**: No additional setup needed - events are handled directly in your application

## Custom Webhooks

To add custom webhook handlers, create new route handlers in the `apps/api/app/webhooks/` directory following the established patterns for security and verification.

## Database Events

One of the most common use cases for inbound webhooks is to notify your application when a database record is created, updated, or deleted. This allows you to react to changes asynchronously, rather than polling the database, cron jobs or other methods.

If you [migrate to Supabase](/migrations/database/supabase), they have an incredibly powerful feature called [Database Webhooks](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/webhooks) that helps with this.
