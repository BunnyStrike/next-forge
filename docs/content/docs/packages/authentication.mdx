# Authentication

next-forge manages authentication through the use of an `auth` package. This package is built around [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) which provides a complete authentication solution that integrates seamlessly with Next.js applications and gives you full control over your authentication logic.

## Features

Better Auth provides a comprehensive authentication system with the following features:

- **Email/Password Authentication**: Built-in support with optional email verification
- **Social Providers**: Google and GitHub OAuth integration
- **Session Management**: Cookie-based sessions with configurable expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin plugin with configurable roles
- **Database Integration**: Direct Prisma integration with your existing database
- **Edge Compatibility**: Works with Vercel Edge Runtime
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety throughout
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over your authentication logic and user data
- **Cost-Effective**: $0 cost compared to third-party services

From here, you can use all the pre-built components and hooks provided by the auth package. To demonstrate this, we've added authentication pages for sign-in and sign-up, as well as session management throughout the application.

## Authentication Events

Better Auth handles authentication events directly in your application without requiring external webhooks. You can customize authentication flows and track events using your preferred analytics service.

## Email Configuration

Better Auth supports custom email providers for authentication emails. You can configure email verification, password reset, and other authentication-related emails through your preferred email service.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` files:

```bash
# Better Auth Core
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-32-character-secret-key"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000" # or your domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database"

# Social Providers (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your-github-client-id"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"
```

## Testing

Since Better Auth runs directly in your application, you can test authentication flows locally without additional configuration. Simply start your development server and navigate to the authentication pages.

## Migration Benefits

The migration from Clerk to Better Auth provides several benefits:

- **Cost Reduction**: $0 vs external service pricing
- **Full Control**: Complete ownership of authentication logic and user data
- **Performance**: No external API dependencies
- **Privacy**: All user data stays in your database
- **Customization**: Unlimited ability to customize authentication flows
- **Edge Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with edge runtimes
